Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------
### What license will the You Are Theme be issued under?
Due to the fact that the original YouAre Theme was issued under the GPU license, I do not think that the You Are Theme can break from that tradition. Before the first stable release, though, I will try to figure out if this is really the case.

### When will the You Are Theme be publicly available for download?
Sometime in mid-July 2013.
