   <div><h2>Installation Screencast</h2>
  <p>I have provided several installation screencasts to get you
  started with the Rewrite theme. Be sure to pay attention, as this
  will help you get the theme installed with ease!</p>
  <p>Theme Setup:</p>
  <iframe src=
  "http://player.vimeo.com/video/35132078?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"
  width="651" height="366" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen=""
  allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
  <h2>Rewrite Installation</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>First of all, you should have WordPress installed and ready to
  roll. It's always recommended that you start with a fresh install
  of WordPress to prevent a conflict of settings from old themes,
  etc. <strong>Make sure you backup your old theme and your posts,
  pages, etc. in case of a catastrophe!</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Unzip the theme package. In the folder you'll find the Rewrite
  docs and a zip titled UploadToWP.zip. <strong>This is the theme zip
  that you need to upload into WordPress.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>In the WordPress admin, go to Appearance -&gt; Themes. Click on
  the big Install Themes tab at the top of the page. Next, click the
  Upload link and navigate to the UploadToWP.zip file. Install and
  activate the theme.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Optional but recommended - Install the dummy data which is
  included. (You can also get it here: <a href=
  "/help/assets/15cc3b9d2fa95fdaf2a182f6f262dba79b50ae00/rewrite.xml">
  rewrite.xml</a>) This will ensure the posts/pages get laid out
  properly with the correct page templates. Go to Tools -&gt; Import
  -&gt; Wordpress. Browse to the Rewrite download folder and locate
  the Dummy Data folder. Select the XML file and upload it. Be sure
  to click "download and import all attachments".</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Rewrite needs the Options Framework plugin to add the theme
  options. You can either click the install prompt at the top of the
  screen, or go to Plugins -&gt; Add New and search for
  <strong>Options Framework</strong>. Install and activate the
  plugin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Next you need to grab the Contact Form 7 plugin. Once again, go
  to Plugins -&gt; Add new. Search for "Contact Form 7". Install this
  plugin. To use this plugin, you'll need to go to the Contact menu
  (now on the left menu) and create a form. Once you're done, it will
  give you a shortcode you can use in your contact page. If you've
  used the dummy data, this should already be in there for you.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Theme Options Setup</h2>
  <p>Theme options are crucial to the Rewrite theme. If you didn't
  watch the screencasts, you can read the directions below. You must
  go through the theme options setup before the theme will work
  properly.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>You'll notice under the Appearence menu, there is a Theme
  Options menu. Click this link.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Under Basic Settings you can upload your logo, set the link
  color, select a background style and insert your Google Analytics
  code. <strong>Save Changes</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Under the Social Media Links tab, you just need to enter your
  social media links for the icons you want to show up on the sticky
  part of the sidebar. <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Wordpress 3.0 Menus</h2>
  <p>Rewrite takes advantage of the new Wordpress 3.0 menu manager.
  Menus can be found under Appearence -&gt; Menus. For more detailed
  usage of the menu manager, see this tutorial <a href=
  "http://www.bestofblogger.net/2010/06/how-to-use-the-wordpress-3-0-menu-creator/"
  title="Menus">here</a>.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>You'll need to create two different menus; one for the header,
  one for the footer. Start with the header menu. Create a menu and
  name it whatever you want.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Now, on the left hand side, select the pages you would like to
  have added to the menu. You can then click "Add to Menu" and they
  will show up on the right side of the page. You can drag the pages
  around to arrange them the way you'd like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Save the menu</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Now let's create the footer menu. At the top of the page you'll
  see a new menu button (has a + on it). Create a new menu and call
  it Footer. Add pages and arrange them the same way you did before.
  When you're finished, save the menu.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Now that you have both menus created, you need to assign them in
  the Theme Locations window located on the left. From the drop down
  menu, select the appropriate menu for the header and footer and
  save.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Widgets</h2>
  <p>I've included a few custom widgets and styled several other
  widgets to help sexify your theme.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Sidebar</strong> - You can put whatever you want in the
  sidebar. I have provided custom Twitter widgets for your use. Just
  drag any widget to the Sidebar pane and be sure to fill out any
  required fields for them to work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Sticky Sidebar</strong> - This is the small sidebar that
  sticks on the page as users scroll. On the demo site I used the
  Twitter widget. You can put whatever you want here as well, but be
  warned that if you put too many items in the sticky footer the
  screen will cut off the sidebar. Since it's position is fixed, it
  will not scroll to show many widgets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Footer Columns</strong>: The footer is divided up into
  three columns. On the demo site, I used a text widget on the left,
  popular tags in the center, and the Okay Twitter widget on the
  right.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Creating Posts</h2>
  <p><strong>Videos</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>Create a new post and add a title and description.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Next, scroll down the page a bit and look for the Custom Fields
  box. <strong>If you don't see the Custom Fields box, look up
  towards the top of your screen and click the Screen Options drop
  down. Make sure Custom Fields is checked.</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Now you can add the Custom Field. The Name is going to be
  <strong>okvideo</strong> and the value will be your embed code. The
  embed code should look something like the code below. <strong>Be
  sure to keep your video width around 690px to fit nicely in the
  theme.</strong> Click Add Custom Field.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p><code>&lt;iframe
  src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/4143170?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0"
  frameborder="0" width="565"
  height="229"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>Once you've added the custom field, you need to be sure to add a
  category or any descriptive tags if you want.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Publish the post when you're finished.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Text Posts</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>Create a new post and add a title and description.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Write your content and add whatever styling you want. If you
  want to have a nice big quote like on the demo site, just use the
  Blockquote button on the WordPress post editor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>When you're finished, be sure to add a category or any
  descriptive tags if you want.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Publish the post when you're finished.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Featured Image Posts</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>Create a new post and add a title and description.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Write your content and add whatever styling you want.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>On the right hand side of your page, you'll see the Featured
  Image Pane. Click Set Featured Image and upload your image. Once
  uploaded, scroll down and click "Use as featured image". Once set,
  you can close the image upload window.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Publish the post when you're finished.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Gallery Image Posts</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>Create a new post and add a title and description.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Write your content and add whatever styling you want.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Click the Upload/Insert Media button. Once the window pops-up,
  drag your images onto the uploader and WordPress will upload
  them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>When the images are done uploading, you can drag and drop them
  in the order you'd like them to appear in your gallery. Save all
  changes when you're done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>The post will use any images you have attached for the gallery
  images. <strong>I suggest keeping your image width at 690px and
  keeping your images proportional as to not look like
  shit.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Publish the post when you're finished.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Shortcodes</h2>
  <p>This theme comes with several shortcodes that will make
  customizing your content easier. I have simplified the use of
  shortcodes by including a Shortcode Manager. On your posts and
  pages, on the editor, you'll see a small cog icon. Click this and a
  small pop-up window will appear. Using the various links across the
  top, you can add buttons, columns, tooltips, and messages. Check
  out the install video (towards the end) for a more detailed look at
  this feature.</p>
  <h2>Post Styles</h2>
  <p>Rewrite comes with a few custom element styles, which are used
  to easily add extra styling to your WordPress posts.</p>
  <p>To use the post styles, simply select your text and then select
  from the drop down which style you would like to apply. You'll be
  able to see the changes live, in your editor.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Highlight</strong> - This will highlight the f**k out of
  some text.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Quote Aside</strong> - This style is an alternative to
  the blockquote. It grabs the text, and throws it to the right of
  the post, and gives it a nice light background. Nice for highlight
  important bits of information or quotes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Page Title</strong> - As seen on the demo, this is a
  nicely styled block of text to introduce your page.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Lightbox Gallery</h2>
  <p>This theme is setup to automatically use the lightbox gallery
  feature on certain portfolio images. If you would like to use it on
  your own images, simply follow the example below. You're basically
  linking a thumbnail photo to a larger photo and adding
  <code>class="lightbox"</code> to the link.</p>
  <p><code>&lt;a href="large-image.jpg" class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img
  src="thumb-image.jpg" alt="lightbox image"
  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
  <p>To create a gallery of images to open in your lightbox, you need
  to instead use <code>class="lightbox[gallerytitle]"</code>.</p>
  <p><code>&lt;a href="large-image.jpg" class="lightbox"
  rel="[gallery]"&gt;&lt;img src="thumb-image.jpg" alt="lightbox
  image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
  <h2>Contact Page</h2>
  <p>The contact page uses the Contact Form 7 plugin, which you
  should have installed earlier. Once installed, you'll see there is
  a <strong>Contact</strong> link in the left hand sidebar of your
  WordPress admin.</p>
  <p>Let's start with displaying a form on your page. First, open the
  Contact -&gt; Edit menu on your WordPress administration panel. You
  can manage multiple contact forms there.</p>
  <p>Just after installing the Contact Form 7 plugin, you'll see a
  default form named "Contact form 1", and a code like this:</p>
  <p>[contact-form 1 "Contact form 1"]</p>
  <p>Copy this code. Then, open the edit menu of the page (Pages
  -&gt; Edit) into which you wish to place the contact form. A
  popular practice is creating a page named "Contact" for the contact
  form page. Paste the code you copied into the contents of the
  page.</p>
  <p>Now your contact form setup is complete. Visitors to your site
  can now find the form and start submitting messages to you.</p>
  <p>To customize this form even further, check out the Contact Form
  7 docs page <a href=
  "http://contactform7.com/blog/2009/11/02/getting-started-with-contact-form-7/">
  here</a>.</p></div>
